I used visual studio 2013....

I also used wamp server as my db... this folder has an exported files of my database 

with a file name practice311.sql



I used the valuesController.cs for the student controller


I also created a class in the model folder with a name Class1.cs

it has three class 

the first one has the properties of the student
the second one is used in creating new student
and the third one is used for reading data of the student





for now this is all I have.......
